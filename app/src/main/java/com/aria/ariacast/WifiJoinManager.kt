/**
 * A deep link (ariacast://...?ssid=...&pass=...) can ask the phone to join a specific
 * Wi-Fi network before casting - e.g. a link that should both switch networks and
 * start casting to a receiver that only lives on that network.
 *
 * This goes through Android's own Settings.ACTION_WIFI_ADD_NETWORKS flow instead of
 * WifiNetworkSpecifier/ConnectivityManager.requestNetwork: the system shows its native
 * "save this Wi-Fi network?" dialog, and once accepted the network is saved and managed
 * exactly as if the user had added it by hand in Settings - the app gets no ownership of
 * it and the platform decides when to associate. That also means there's nothing for
 * AudioCastService to release when casting stops; the network simply stays saved, like
 * any other Wi-Fi network on the phone.
